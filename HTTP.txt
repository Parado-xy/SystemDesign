HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite model for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.
[1] HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.
Development of HTTP was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989 and summarized in a simple document describing the behavior of a client and a server using the first HTTP version, named 0.9.
[2] That version was subsequently developed, eventually becoming the public 1.0.[3]
Development of early HTTP Requests for Comments (RFCs) started a few years later in a coordinated effort by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with work later moving to the IETF.
HTTP/1 was finalized and fully documented (as version 1.0) in 1996.
[4] It evolved (as version 1.1) in 1997 and then its specifications were updated in 1999, 2014, and 2022.
[5] Its secure variant named HTTPS is used by more than 85% of websites.[6]
HTTP/2, published in 2015, provides a more efficient expression of HTTP's semantics "on the wire". As of August 2024, it is supported by 66.2% of websites[7][8] 
(35.3% HTTP/2 + 30.9% HTTP/3 with backwards compatibility) and supported by almost all web browsers (over 98% of users).[9] 
It is also supported by major web servers over Transport Layer Security (TLS) using an Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) extension[10] where TLS 1.2 or newer is required.[11][12]
HTTP/3, the successor to HTTP/2, was published in 2022.[13] As of February 2024, it is now used on 30.9% of websites[14] and is supported by most web browsers, i.e. (at least partially) supported by 97% of users.[15] HTTP/3 uses QUIC instead of TCP for the underlying transport protocol. Like HTTP/2, it does not obsolete previous major versions of the protocol. Support for HTTP/3 was added to Cloudflare and Google Chrome first,[16][17] and is also enabled in Firefox.[18] HTTP/3 has lower latency for real-world web pages, if enabled on the server, and loads faster than with HTTP/2, in some cases over three times faster than HTTP/1.1 (which is still commonly only enabled).[19]
